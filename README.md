# The Atom Smart Golf Ball
The goal is to create a smart golfball that can be tracked via a smartphone app to provide golfers insights into their game.

## The Goal to Accomplish
```Figure out a way to create a micro chipset that can be implanted into a high performance golf ball for an economical price. This ball will be smart enough to track several datapoints such as ball speed, carry distance, spin rate, smash factor, launch angle, club path, and gps tracking. Even if its lost during a round, another user could find it, reset and reconnect it with their smartphone, then continue to recieve insights for further improvement. When the smart ball starts wearing out it can be sent back for refurbishment.```
