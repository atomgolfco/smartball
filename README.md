# THE ATOM SMART GOLF BALL
The goal is to create a smart golfball that can be tracked via a smartphone app to provide golfers insights into their game.

## The Goal to Accomplish
```Figure out a way to create a micro chipset that can be implanted into a high performance golf ball for an economical price. This ball will be smart enough to track several datapoints such as ball speed, carry distance, spin rate, smash factor, launch angle, club path, and gps tracking. Even if its lost during a round, another user could find it, reset and reconnect it with their smartphone, then continue to recieve insights for further improvement. When the smart ball starts wearing out it can be sent back for refurbishment.```

## The Technology Behind It All
```Will need to find a small chipset manufacturer that can create a device small enough to fit inside the golf ball core. The specs should have gps, radar, sensors, battery, bluetooth, wifi and other electronic components soldered onto the pcb motherboard. Then before assembly have it go through a water resistant process so the ball can be submerged into water for a period of time. Maybe the same application apple uses on their watches. We'll have to write a low level language/framework that can be flashed onto the device in a way it can recieve automatic updates. Once completed, create cloud based platform preferably on kubernetes that a user can log into so all this data can be saved and processed later on for analysis. This will help every user gain insights on their golf game over a long period of time. Then with neurolink technology you can integrate your mental game with your physical game. Since golf is 80% mental and 20% physical you'll be able to improve in a quicker amount of time.```
